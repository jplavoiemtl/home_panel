# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working Guidelines

1. **Think first, then read**: Before making any changes, think through the problem and read relevant files in the codebase.

2. **Check in before major changes**: Before making any major changes, check in with the user to verify the plan.

3. **Explain changes at a high level**: At every step, provide a high-level explanation of what changes were made.

4. **Keep it simple**: Make every task and code change as simple as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Simplicity is paramount.

5. **Maintain architecture documentation**: Keep a documentation file that describes how the architecture of the app works inside and out.

6. **Never speculate about unread code**: Never make claims about code you haven't opened. If a specific file is referenced, read it before answering. Investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Give grounded, hallucination-free answers.
